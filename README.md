# FUSE library for Go

Cgofuse is a FUSE library for Go using cgo. The benefit is that this library can be ported to all platforms that have a FUSE implementation. This includes Windows with my own [WinFsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp).

Please note that this library is written by an extreme Go novice. At the time of this writing I probably have less than 10 hours of actual Go "experience". So keep the laughs to a minimum!
